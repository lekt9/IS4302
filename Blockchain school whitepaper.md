## **1. Abstract**

The **Restaurant Incentive System (RIS)** is a cutting-edge blockchain-based platform designed to balance restaurant traffic and enhance user engagement through a dynamic USDT (Tether) ratio mechanism. By leveraging real-time transaction data and on-chain calculations, RIS adjusts incentives to encourage diners to visit less crowded restaurants, ensuring an optimal distribution of customers across participating venues. This white paper outlines the challenges in the Food & Beverage (F&B) industry, introduces the RIS solution, details its technical architecture, economic model, and implementation plan, and discusses future enhancements.

## **2. Introduction**

### **2.1. Background**

The F&B industry is a cornerstone of urban economies, contributing significantly to employment and cultural diversity. In bustling cities like Singapore, restaurants often face uneven customer flow, with peak hours leading to overcrowding and off-peak times resulting in underutilized capacity. Traditional marketing and loyalty programs have been insufficient in addressing these challenges.

### **2.2. Problem Statement**

- **Inefficient Customer Distribution:** Popular restaurants experience excessive demand during peak hours, causing long wait times and diminished customer satisfaction, while other restaurants have empty seats.
- **Lack of Effective Incentives:** Existing promotions fail to dynamically adapt to real-time demand fluctuations, leading to suboptimal resource utilization.
- **Limited Customer Engagement:** Generic offers do not cater to individual preferences, reducing the effectiveness of marketing efforts.

### **2.3. Objectives**

The RIS aims to:

- **Balance Restaurant Traffic:** Dynamically adjust incentives to distribute customers more evenly across restaurants.
- **Enhance User Experience:** Provide personalized recommendations and cost savings to diners.
- **Optimize Restaurant Operations:** Increase revenue by filling empty seats during off-peak hours.
- **Leverage Blockchain Technology:** Ensure transparency, security, and efficiency in transactions.

---

## **3. Market Analysis**

### **3.1. F&B Industry Challenges**

- **Overcrowding:** High demand during peak hours strains resources and affects service quality.
- **Underutilization:** Off-peak periods lead to revenue losses due to idle capacity.
- **Competitive Environment:** Restaurants struggle to differentiate themselves and attract customers consistently.

### **3.2. Customer Behavior Insights**

- **Preference for Convenience:** Diners value reduced wait times and seamless experiences.
- **Sensitivity to Value:** Price incentives can influence dining choices.
- **Desire for Personalization:** Tailored recommendations enhance engagement and satisfaction.

---

## **4. The RIS Solution**

### **4.1. Overview**

The **Restaurant Incentive System (RIS)** introduces a dynamic pricing mechanism where the USDT ratio adjusts in real-time based on transaction volumes at each restaurant. By incentivizing diners to choose less crowded venues, RIS promotes a balanced distribution of customers.

### **4.2. Benefits of Blockchain Technology**

- **Transparency:** All transactions and ratio adjustments are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring accountability.
- **Security:** Decentralized ledger technology protects against data tampering and fraud.
- **Efficiency:** Smart contracts automate processes, reducing operational overhead.

### **4.3. Dynamic Incentive Mechanism**

The core of the system is an on-chain algorithm that calculates a custom USDT ratio for each restaurant, influencing the value users receive when redeeming USDT at that venue. This ratio decreases as a restaurant's transaction volume increases, offering better value at less crowded establishments.

---

## **5. Technical Architecture**

### **5.1. System Components**

- **Smart Contracts:** Deployed on the **Polygon** network to handle payments and dynamic ratio calculations.
- **Frontend Application:** A web-based interface for users to interact with the system.
- **Backend Services:** Handle order processing, data storage, and provide APIs for the frontend.

### **5.2. Smart Contract Design**

The smart contract is central to RIS, responsible for:

- **Processing Payments:** Facilitating transactions between users and restaurants.
- **Calculating Ratios:** Computing the dynamic USDT ratio on-chain during each payment based on recent transaction volumes.
- **Storing Data:** Maintaining transaction volumes for accurate ratio calculations.

#### **Smart Contract Functions**

- `pay(address restaurant, uint256 usdtAmount)`: Users call this function to make payments.
- `_calculateCustomRatio(address restaurant)`: Internal function to compute the dynamic ratio.
- `_updateVolumes(address restaurant, uint256 usdtAmount)`: Updates transaction volumes.

### **5.3. On-Chain Ratio Calculation**

The custom ratio is calculated using the following variables and parameters:

- **Total Transactions per Restaurant (TTₐ):** Sum of USDT amounts paid at restaurant A within a specified time window.
- **Total Transactions Across All Restaurants (TT_total):** Sum of USDT amounts paid across all participating restaurants within the same period.
- **Base Ratio (BR):** Default exchange rate when transaction volume is minimal.
- **Decay Factor (DF):** Determines how much the ratio decreases as transaction volume increases.
- **Minimum Ratio (MR):** Ensures the ratio doesn't fall below a set threshold.

**Algorithm Steps:**

1. **Update Transaction Volumes:** Record each transaction amount and timestamp on-chain.
2. **Calculate Relative Share:** `relative_share = TTₐ / TT_total`
3. **Determine Decay:** `decay = relative_share × DF × BR`
4. **Calculate Current Ratio:** `current_ratio = BR - decay`, ensuring `current_ratio ≥ MR`
5. **Apply Custom Ratio:** Adjust the payment amount using `current_ratio`.

### **5.4. Data Management**

- **On-Chain Storage:** Transaction volumes are stored on-chain to enable transparent and tamper-proof calculations.
- **Gas Optimization:** Data structures and cleanup functions are designed to minimize gas costs.
- **Scalability Considerations:** Strategies such as data aggregation and efficient algorithms are employed to handle high transaction volumes.

## **14. Appendix**

### **14.1. Algorithm Details**

**Custom Ratio Calculation Algorithm**

**Variables:**

- `TTₐ`: Total USDT redeemed at restaurant A within the time window.
- `TT_total`: Total USDT redeemed across all restaurants within the same time window.
- `BR`: Base ratio (e.g., 1.00).
- `DF`: Decay factor (e.g., 0.5).
- `MR`: Minimum ratio (e.g., 0.90).
- `Time Window`: The period over which transaction volumes are considered (e.g., 1 hour).

**Steps:**

1. **Update Transaction Volumes:**
   - Record each transaction amount and timestamp on-chain.
   - Maintain separate records for each restaurant and total transactions.

2. **Calculate Relative Share:**
   - `relative_share = TTₐ / TT_total`
   - If `TT_total` is zero, `relative_share` is set to zero to prevent division by zero errors.

3. **Determine Decay:**
   - `decay = relative_share × DF × BR`

4. **Calculate Current Ratio:**
   - `current_ratio = BR - decay`
   - Ensure `current_ratio` does not fall below `MR`.

5. **Apply Custom Ratio:**
   - Adjust the payment amount using `current_ratio`.
   - Example: If a user redeems 100 USDT at a restaurant with a `current_ratio` of 0.95, they receive SGD 95.

**Example Parameters:**

- **BR (Base Ratio):** 1.00 (1 USDT = 1 SGD)
- **DF (Decay Factor):** 0.5
- **MR (Minimum Ratio):** 0.90
- **Time Window:** 1 hour

**Calculation Example:**

- **Restaurant A:**
  - `TTₐ = 500 USDT`
- **All Restaurants:**
  - `TT_total = 1000 USDT`
- **Relative Share:**
  - `relative_share = 500 / 1000 = 0.5`
- **Decay:**
  - `decay = 0.5 × 0.5 × 1.00 = 0.25`
- **Current Ratio:**
  - `current_ratio = 1.00 - 0.25 = 0.75`
  - Since `0.75 < MR (0.90)`, set `current_ratio = 0.90`

**Final Ratio:**
- `current_ratio = 0.90`
